# CZ2006_StrayFinder
Stray Finder is a mobile application that aims to address the gap of stray cat welfare and monitoring in Singapore. It primarily serves two types of users, 1. volunteers from stray cat management organisations, and 2. members of the public who would like to chip in and help stray cats they encounter on the streets. Below is a complete list of features for each type of user:

User(Volunteer) Features:
1. Injury Noticeboard -- Injured stray cats reported by user(passerby) information card will appear in real time updates for user(volunteer) to choose to handle i.e. follow up and take the injured stray cat to the vet
2. Vet Map -- A map of all registered and licensed vet centres in Singapore. Nearest 5 vet centres can be shortlisted by location of the user.
3. Cat Map -- A map of all stray cats registed in the database of the app. Due to privacy concerns, the details and whereabouts of the cats are only known to volunteers.

User(Passerby) Features:
1. Report -- Members of the public can report a stray cat they encountered on the streets. If the stray cat does not exist in the database, the passerby will be prompted to name the cat. If the stray cat is injured, the passerby can also report the injury and indicate if he/she will be bringing the cat to the vet. Once the injury is reported, this will be updated at the 'Injury Noticeboard' feature for volunteers.
2. Vet Map -- A map of all registered and licensed vet centres in Singapore. Nearest 5 vet centres can be shortlisted by location of the user.
3. Adopt -- A list of organisations offering cats for adoption with contact details of the organisations are provided for viewing.
